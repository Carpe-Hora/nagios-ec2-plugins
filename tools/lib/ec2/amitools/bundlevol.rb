BUNDLE_VOL_MANUAL=<<TEXT
#{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME} is a command line tool that creates an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
from an existing Fedora Core installation and bundles it. Its output is a
bundled AMI consisting of AMI parts and a manifest. Use the '--help'
option to display help on Bundle Volume parameters.

#{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME} can be run from within an installation, provided there is sufficient space
for the AMI in the destination directory. Note that running Bundle Volume from
within a running installation may be problematic because partially written files
may get copied into the AMI. To minimize this risk it is recommended that the
system is brought down to runlevel 1. Note that this will stop networking, so
only do this if you have access to the console.

If #{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME} is not run from within the installation, the volume belonging to the
installation must be mounted so that it is accessible to #{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME}.

#{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME} will:
- create a sparse filesystem image
- recursively copy the specified volume into the image
- tar -S the image to preserve the sparseness of the image file
- compress the image
- encrypt it
- split it into parts
- generate a manifest file describing the bundled AMI

Recursive Copying

The recursive copying process copies directories from the volume into the image.
The special directories:
  
- '/dev'
- '/media'
- '/mnt'
- '/proc'
- '/sys'

are always excluded.

Files matching the following regular expressions:

- '*/#*#'
- '*/.#*'
- '*.sw'
- '*.swo'
- '*.swp'
- '*~'
- '*.pem'
- '*.priv'
- '*id_rsa*'
- '*id_dsa*'
- '*.gpg'
- '*.jks'
- '*/.ssh/authorized_keys'
- '*/.bash_history'

are excluded by default on Linux. Individual files that match these patterns may be
included by specifying the '--include' option.
  
Local directories, which are copied by default, are defined to be those on
filesystems of the following types:
  
- ext2
- ext3
- xfs
- jfs
- reiserfs

Directories on filesystems that are not of one of the types listed above, such as
remotely mounted NFS filesystems, are excluded by default, but can be copied
by using the '--all' option.
  
Symbolic links are preserved by the copying process, provided the link target is
copied.
  
Mounted File Systems

#{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME} will default to bundling the existing /etc/fstab file.

#{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME} will create and bundle AMIs of up to 10GB.

Note:
  Creating the filesystem on the image may fail in the presence of selinux.
  If you are using selinux, you should disable it before using #{BUNDLE_VOL_NAME}.
